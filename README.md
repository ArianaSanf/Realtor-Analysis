My target audience for this report are those who want a more in-depth analysis of real estate in the United States focussing on the Northeastern region, the information pertains to house sizes and pricing within
the Northeastern and MidAtlantic US with outliers in Wyoming and California. My goal is to create a visualization of average rising prices over time and by average prices within the Northeast. The findings will 
show the average prices of homes by state zip codes and what regions are doing the best. As well as average house size by price. My KPIs are, focused on the Northeastern region's average price by zip code, rising 
home prices over time, and average price of homes by state.
